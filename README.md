# AudioFunctions
Small collection of code I've used in the past to create/modify audio files for experiments.

Right now this is still going to be a random collection of python scripts that accomplish 
a somewhat random assortment of tasks I used during my PhD to create, modify, or otherwise
manipulate sound files.

I'll update this Read Me as I actually find and add these scripts.

The final goal of this project is to actually merge all of these into a single GUI
to share with my current and former labs to ease audio processing for research assistants
and graduate students.

Current scripts:
- batch_rename.py: This is a simple GUI for renaming all files with a given extension
in a particular folder by appending or prepending characters. I found this useful when
I had made modifications to a large set of files (such as by adding noise, or vocoding)
