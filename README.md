# AudioFunctions
Small collection of code I've used in the past to create/modify audio files for experiments.

Right now this is still going to be a random collection of python scripts that accomplish 
a somewhat random assortment of tasks I used during my PhD to create, modify, or otherwise
manipulate sound files.

I'll update this Read Me as I actually find and add these scripts.

The final goal of this project is to actually merge all of these into a single GUI
to share with my current and former labs to ease audio processing for research assistants
and graduate students.
